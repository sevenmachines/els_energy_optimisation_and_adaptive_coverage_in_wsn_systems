\subsection{The multi-objective optimisation problem}
\label{section:optimisation_problem}

The goal of a system of agents $\setAgents{}{}$ is to maximise $\functionSystemUtility{}{}$ over the lifetime of the WSN. In doing so the system should optimise over the multiple objectives below, 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maximising $\functionEnergyAvailable{}{}$, the energy available to ensure functionality and coverage of nodes.
	\item Maximising $\functionEnergyVariability{}{}$,  the distribution of energy to prolong system lifetime.
	\item Increase $\functionAtomicTaskQualitySignature{}{}$, the quality of the individual atomic tasks.
\end{enumerate}
There should also be an increase in resilience as the system tries to maintain coverage $\functionSystemCoverage{}{}$ through optimising task quality as node failures occur throughout the systems' lifetime.
