With a CTV balance optimised solely to minimise energy consumption, i.e. $(\alpha=1,\beta=0,\gamma=0)$, the \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm acts as an arc-length miniminising algorithm. This makes it comparable to WSN route-optimisation learning algorithms such as Q-routing \cite{XXX}, XXX, and XXX.
