With a CTV balance optimised solely to minimise energy consumption, i.e. $(\alpha=1,\beta=0,\gamma=0)$, the \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm behaves similarly to energy-aware algorithms applied to WSN. In this configuration comparisons can be made with algorithms such as PEGASIS \citep{Lindsey2002}, or more closely to Q-routing algorithms like Q-probabilistic routing \citep{Arroyo-Valles2007}. However, the task allocation and resource optimisation component of the \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm is not accounted for in these implementations so provides only a comparison for the energy and route adaptation properties.
