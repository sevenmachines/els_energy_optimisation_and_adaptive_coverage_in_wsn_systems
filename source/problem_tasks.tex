\subsubsection*{Quality of measurement}

\todo[inline]{PROBLEM - TASKS}
A sensor is capable of taking a measurement of the radiation levels at the location of its sensor, which may be a distance away from the tasks' demand point. In addition, the longer the sample time the more energy is used, but the more accurate the reading will be \cite{dummy}. We therefore define the value of the measurement as follows,

\begin{definition}[Atomic task value]
	The \textit{atomic task value} of an atomic task $\varAtomicTask{}{}$ is a function of the distance of the task from the requested position, and the amount of energy used to make the measurement.
	\begin{equation}
		\functionAtomicTaskQualitySignature{}{} = \varEnergy{\varAtomicTask{}{}}{} \times \funcSize{\funcSize{\varLocation{\varAtomicTask{}{}}{} - \varLocation{\varAgent{}{}}{}}{}}{}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Composite task quality]
	The \textit{composite task quality} of $\varCompositeTask{}{}$ is a measure of the quality of the atomic tasks that compose it, the remaining energy available to the agents that completed those atomic tasks, and the overall variability of the energy over those agents. 
	\begin{equation}
		\functionCompositeTaskQuality{}{} = XXX
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
