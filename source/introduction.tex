\section{Introduction}

\todo{Why is the subject/problem area important?}
\textit{Environmental wireless sensor networks (E-WSN)} are often deployed in remote, dispersed environments where connectivity may be low or intermittent. There may be signal noise, connection dropout, sensor failure, and components may fail as environmental pressures lead to degradation. Under these circumstances an agent system provides for the adaptive nature that is needed to allow the system to alter itself to better suit the current conditions, increasing its robustness in face of operational challenges. These requirements help to make this group of applications a particularly well aligned one in which to examine agent behaviours under constraints. We will look at some of the common characteristics across different use cases of sensor networks in the environment, and harness these demands to justify our functionality choices and compromises within the agent system.
