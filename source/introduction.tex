\section{Introduction}

\todo[inline]]{Why is the subject/problem area important?}
\textit{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)} have many applications and research studies in areas such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, and military uses (See Table \ref{table:applications}). More recently, the availability and lower cost of low-power wireless transmitters \citep{902661}, solar-harvesting components \citep{Prauzek2018}, and micro-electro-mechanical systems \citep{1045391} has allowed large deployments sizes and scope of use, expanding their real-world use and opening up new areas for practical research \citep{Kandris2020}.
