\section{Conclusions and future work}
\label{section:conclusions}

\subsection{What we did}
This works looked at the application of the previously described \acronymATARIA{}{} and \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithms (\ref{XXX}) and their application to wireless sensor network optimisation in dynamic and challenging environments.
\todo[inline]{What we showed}

\todo[inline]{What use is this}
As the evaluation has shown, the algorithm described optimised both the utility and energy availability of the realistic WSN systems detailed in Section \ref{section:results}. Through use of multiple objectives of energy availablity, distribution, and task value, as defined in Section \ref{XXX}, we were able to show through evaluation in the simulated system that these properties could be prioritised for optimisation. Using this flexibility, the algorithm could be configured to optimise the WSN system to target these desired outcomes.
 
\todo[inline]{What further applications or extensions are possible}
There are a number of applications in WSN in which the agents involved are mobile, such as in Vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANET) \ref{XXX}.
