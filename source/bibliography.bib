abstract = {Radioactive contamination is the result of regular operation of nuclear power plants, leakage or accident during the production, or use of radionuclides (radioisotopes). They occur throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and continue to give off harmful radioactive particles and rays for very protracted periods. Radioactive elements can contaminate water adversely affecting human health as well as aquatic lives. It is difficult to manually collect water samples and test the presence of radioactive contamination in those samples. This also limits the area of collection. This paper reviews various methods of detecting radioactive contamination in water resources, their advantages, shortcomings and challenges during implementation. The authors have found self-maintaining, scalable, low cost Zigbee based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) supporting web technology for detecting and monitoring nuclear radiation technique developed by Li Wu et al. (2014) the most appropriate.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerge as an active research area in which challenging topics involve energy consumption, routing algorithms, selection of sensors location according to a given premise, robustness, efficiency, and so forth. Despite the open problems in WSNs, there are already a high number of applications available. In all cases for the design of any application, one of the main objectives is to keep the WSN alive and functional as long as possible. A key factor in this is the way the network is formed. This survey presents most recent formation techniques and mechanisms for the WSNs. In this paper, the reviewed works are classified into distributed and centralized techniques. The analysis is focused on whether a single or multiple sinks are employed, nodes are static or mobile, the formation is event detection based or not, and network backbone is formed or not. We focus on recent works and present a discussion of their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, the paper overviews a series of open issues which drive further research in the area.},

	ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks have gained significant traction in environmental signal monitoring and analysis. The cost or lifetime of the system typically depends on the frequency at which environmental phenomena are monitored. If sampling rates are reduced, energy is saved. Using empirical datasets collected from environmental monitoring sensor networks, this work performs time series analyses of measured temperature time series. Unlike previous works which have concentrated on suppressing the transmission of some data samples by time-series analysis but still maintaining high sampling rates, this work investigates reducing the sampling rate (and sensor wake up rate) and looks at the effects on accuracy. Results show that the sampling period of the sensor can be increased up to one hour while still allowing intermediate and future states to be estimated with interpolation RMSE less than 0.2 °C and forecasting RMSE less than 1 °C.},

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A self-sustainable wireless sensor node for the monitoring radiation in contaminated and poorly accessible areas is presented. The node is designed to work in collaboration with an unmanned aerial vehicle used for two essential mission steps: air-deploying the wireless sensor nodes at suitable locations and acquiring data logs via ultra-low power, short-range radio communication in fly-by mode, after a wake-up routine. The system allows for the use of off-the-shelf components for defining mission, drop-zone and trajectory, for compressing data, and for communication management. The node is equipped with a low-power nuclear radiation sensor and it was designed and implemented with self-sustainability in mind as it will be deployed in hazardous, inaccessible areas. To this end, the proposed node uses a combination of complementary techniques: a low-power microcontroller with non-volatile memory, energy harvesting, adaptive power management and duty cycling, and a nano-watt wake-up radio. Experimental results show the power consumption efficiency of the solution, which achieves 70uW in sleep mode and 500uW in active mode. Finally, simulations based on actual field measurements confirm the solution's self-sustainability and illustrate the impact of different sampling rates and that of the wake-up radio.},

EWSNs require elaborate device composition and advanced control to attain long-term operation with minimal maintenance. This article is focused on power supplies that provide energy to run the wireless sensor nodes in environmental applications. In this context, EWSNs have two distinct features that set them apart from monitoring systems in other application domains. They are often deployed in remote areas, preventing the use of mains power and precluding regular visits to exchange batteries. At the same time, their surroundings usually provide opportunities to harvest ambient energy and use it to (partially) power the sensor nodes. This review provides a comprehensive account of energy harvesting sources, energy storage devices, and corresponding topologies of energy harvesting systems, focusing on studies published within the last 10 years. Current trends and future directions in these areas are also covered.},

abstract = {We present a self-organising reinforcement learning (RL) approach for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The approach is fully decentralised, and allows sensor nodes to schedule their active periods based only on their interactions with neighbouring nodes. Compared to standard scheduling mechanisms such as SMAC, the benefits of the proposed approach are twofold. First, the nodes do not need to synchronise explicitly, since synchronisation is achieved by the successful exchange of data messages in the data collection process. Second, the learning process allows nodes competing for the radio channel to desynchronise in such a way that radio interferences and therefore packet collisions are significantly reduced. This results in shorter communication schedules, allowing to not only reduce energy consumption by reducing the wake-up cycles of sensor nodes, but also to decrease the data retrieval latency. We implement this RL approach in the OMNET++ sensor network simulator, and illustrate how sensor nodes arranged in line, mesh and grid topologies autonomously uncover schedules that favour the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while avoiding interferences.},

WSNs are collections of sensor nodes that gather environmental data, where the main challenges are the limited power supply of nodes and the need for decentralized control. To overcome these challenges, we make each sensor node adopt an algorithm to optimize the efficiency of a small group of surrounding nodes, so that in the end the performance of the whole system is improved.

ABSTRACT = {Optimization problems relating to wireless sensor network planning, design, deployment and operation often give rise to multi-objective optimization formulations where multiple desirable objectives compete with each other and the decision maker has to select one of the tradeoff solutions. These multiple objectives may or may not conflict with each other. Keeping in view the nature of the application, the sensing scenario and input/output of the problem, the type of optimization problem changes. To address different nature of optimization problems relating to wireless sensor network design, deployment, operation, planing and placement, there exist a plethora of optimization solution types. We review and analyze different desirable objectives to show whether they conflict with each other, support each other or they are design dependent. We also present a generic multi-objective optimization problem relating to wireless sensor network which consists of input variables, required output, objectives and constraints. A list of constraints is also presented to give an overview of different constraints which are considered while formulating the optimization problems in wireless sensor networks. Keeping in view the multi facet coverage of this article relating to multi-objective optimization, this will open up new avenues of research in the area of multi-objective optimization relating to wireless sensor networks.},

abstract="Visual coverage is an essential issue in the research on visual sensor networks. However, because of the presence of visual occlusions, the statistics of visual coverage blend the statistics of nodes and targets and are extremely difficult to derive. By assuming the deployment of nodes as a stationary Poisson point process and ignoring boundary effects, this paper presents the first attempt to estimate the probability that an arbitrary target in the field is visually k-covered. The major challenge for the estimation is how to formulate the probability (q) that a node captures a target in its visual range. To tackle this challenge, we first assume a visual detection model that takes visual occlusions into account and then derive several significant statistical parameters of q based on this model. According to these parameters, we can finally reconstruct the probability density function of q as a combination of a Binomial function and an impulse function. With the estimated coverage statistics, we further propose an estimate of the minimum node density that suffices to ensure a K-coverage across the field.",

For most sensor network applications, point-to-point reliability is not the main objective; instead, reliable event-of-interest delivery to the server needs to be guaranteed (possibly with a certain probability). The nature of communication in sensor networks is unpredictable and failure-prone, even more so than in regular wireless ad hoc networks. Therefore, it is essential to provide fault tolerant techniques for distributed sensor applications. Many recent studies in this area take drastically different approaches to addressing the fault tolerance issue in routing, transport and/or application layers.

ABSTRACT = {The most important issue that must be solved in designing a data gathering algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNS) is how to save sensor node energy while meeting the needs of applications/users. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware routing protocol (EAP) for a long-lived sensor network. EAP achieves a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load among all the nodes. EAP introduces a new clustering parameter for cluster head election, which can better handle the heterogeneous energy capacities. Furthermore, it also introduces a simple but efficient approach, namely, intra-cluster coverage to cope with the area coverage problem. We use a simple temperature sensing application to evaluate the performance of EAP and results show that our protocol significantly outperforms LEACH and HEED in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data gathered.},

Despite the successes gained, the widespread adoption of WSNs particularly in remote and inaccessible places where their use is most beneficial is hampered by the major challenge of limited energy, being in most instances battery powered. To prolong the lifetime for these energy hungry sensor nodes, energy management schemes have been proposed in the literature to keep the sensor nodes alive making the network more operational and efficient. Currently, emphasis has been placed on energy harvesting, energy transfer, and energy conservation methods as the primary means of maintaining the network lifetime. These energy management techniques are designed to balance the energy in the overall network.

As such, the network lifetime has been acritical concern in WSN research. While numerous energy-efficient protocols have been proposed to prolong the network lifetime, various definitions of network lifetime have also been used for the differentscenarios and protocols. The lifetime of a sensor network is most commonly defined as the time to the first sensor node failure - seemingly over-pessimistic in many envisaged deployment scenarios. While other definitions exist, there has not been any consensus on which quantitative lifetime definition is most useful.

    abstract = { Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an attractive platform for monitoring and measuring physical phenomena. WSNs typically consist of hundreds or thousands of battery-operated tiny sensor nodes which are connected via a low data rate wireless network. A WSN application, such as object tracking or environmental monitoring, is composed of individual tasks which must be scheduled on each node. Naturally the order of task execution influences the performance of the WSN application. Scheduling the tasks such that the performance is increased while the energy consumption remains low is a key challenge. In this paper we apply online learning to task scheduling in order to explore the tradeoff between performance and energy consumption. This helps to dynamically identify effective scheduling policies for the sensor nodes. The energy consumption for computation and communication is represented by a parameter for each application task. We compare resource-aware task scheduling based on three online learning methods: independent reinforcement learning (RL), cooperative reinforcement learning (CRL), and exponential weight for exploration and exploitation (Exp3). Our evaluation is based on the performance and energy consumption of a prototypical target tracking application. We further determine the communication overhead and computational effort of these methods. }

abstract = {The increased demand of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in different areas of application have intensified studies dedicated to the deployment of sensor nodes in recent past. For deployment of sensor nodes some of the key objectives that need to be satisfied are coverage of the area to be monitored, net energy consumed by the WSN, lifetime of the network, and connectivity and number of deployed sensors. In this article the sensor node deployment task has been formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization (MO) problem where the aim is to find a deployed sensor node arrangement to maximize the area of coverage, minimize the net energy consumption, maximize the network lifetime, and minimize the number of deployed sensor nodes while maintaining connectivity between each sensor node and the sink node for proper data transmission. We assume a tree structure between the deployed nodes and the sink node for data transmission. Our method employs a recently developed and very competitive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) known as MOEA/D-DE that uses a decomposition approach for converting the problem of approximation of the Pareto fronts (PF) into a number of single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm employs differential evolution (DE), one of the most powerful real parameter optimizers in current use, as its search method. The original MOEA/D has been modified by introducing a new fuzzy dominance based decomposition technique. The algorithm introduces a fuzzy Pareto dominance concept to compare two solutions and uses the scalar decomposition method only when one of the solutions fails to dominate the other in terms of a fuzzy dominance level. We have compared the performance of the resulting algorithm, called MOEA/DFD, with the original MOEA/D-DE and another very popular MOEA called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The best trade-off solutions from MOEA/DFD based node deployment scheme have also been compared with a few single-objective node deployment schemes based on the original DE, an adaptive DE-variant (JADE), original particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a state-of-the art variant of PSO (Comprehensive Learning PSO). In all the test instances, MOEA/DFD performs better than all other algorithms. Also the proposed multi-objective formulation of the problem adds more flexibility to the decision maker for choosing the necessary threshold of the objectives to be satisfied.}

abstract = {The fundamental challenge for randomly deployed resource-constrained wireless sensor network is to enhance the network lifetime without compromising its performance metrics such as coverage rate and network connectivity. One way is to schedule the activities of sensor nodes and form scheduling rounds autonomously in such a way that each spatial point is covered by at least one sensor node and there must be at least one communication path from the sensor nodes to base station. This autonomous activity scheduling of the sensor nodes can be efficiently done with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique of machine learning because it does not require prior environment modeling. In this paper, a Nash Q-Learning based node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance (CCM-RL) is proposed where each node autonomously learns its optimal action (active/hibernate/sleep/customize the sensing range) to maximize the coverage rate and maintain network connectivity. The learning algorithm resides inside each sensor node. The main objective of this algorithm is to enable the sensor nodes to learn their optimal action so that the total number of activated nodes in each scheduling round becomes minimum and preserves the criteria of coverage rate and network connectivity. The comparison of CCM-RL protocol with other protocols proves its accuracy and reliability. The simulative comparison shows that CCM-RL performs better in terms of an average number of active sensor nodes in one scheduling round, coverage rate, and energy consumption.},

abstract = {—Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of distributed autonomous devices that can sense or monitor physical or environmental conditions cooperatively. WSNs face many challenges, mainly caused by communication failures, storage and computational constraints and limited power supply. Paradigms of computational intelligence (CI) have been successfully used in recent years to address various challenges such as data aggregation and fusion, energy aware routing, task scheduling, security, optimal deployment and localization. CI provides adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness against topology changes, communication failures and scenario changes. However, WSN developers are usually not or not completely aware of the potential CI algorithms offer. On the other side, CI researchers are not familiar with all real problems and subtle requirements of WSNs. This mismatch makes collaboration and development difficult. This paper intends to close this gap and foster collaboration by offering a detailed introduction to WSNs and their properties. An extensive survey of CI applications to various problems in WSNs from various research areas and publication venues is presented in the paper. Besides, a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of CI algorithms over traditional WSN solutions is offered. In addition, a general evaluation of CI algorithms is presented, which will serve as a guide for using CI algorithms for WSNs.},
