@article{Yick2008a,
	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A self-sustainable wireless sensor node for the monitoring radiation in contaminated and poorly accessible areas is presented. The node is designed to work in collaboration with an unmanned aerial vehicle used for two essential mission steps: air-deploying the wireless sensor nodes at suitable locations and acquiring data logs via ultra-low power, short-range radio communication in fly-by mode, after a wake-up routine. The system allows for the use of off-the-shelf components for defining mission, drop-zone and trajectory, for compressing data, and for communication management. The node is equipped with a low-power nuclear radiation sensor and it was designed and implemented with self-sustainability in mind as it will be deployed in hazardous, inaccessible areas. To this end, the proposed node uses a combination of complementary techniques: a low-power microcontroller with non-volatile memory, energy harvesting, adaptive power management and duty cycling, and a nano-watt wake-up radio. Experimental results show the power consumption efficiency of the solution, which achieves 70uW in sleep mode and 500uW in active mode. Finally, simulations based on actual field measurements confirm the solution's self-sustainability and illustrate the impact of different sampling rates and that of the wake-up radio.},

abstract = {The operational efficiency of remote environmental wireless sensor networks (EWSNs) has improved tremendously with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies over the past few years. EWSNs require elaborate device composition and advanced control to attain long-term operation with minimal maintenance. This article is focused on power supplies that provide energy to run the wireless sensor nodes in environmental applications. In this context, EWSNs have two distinct features that set them apart from monitoring systems in other application domains. They are often deployed in remote areas, preventing the use of mains power and precluding regular visits to exchange batteries. At the same time, their surroundings usually provide opportunities to harvest ambient energy and use it to (partially) power the sensor nodes. This review provides a comprehensive account of energy harvesting sources, energy storage devices, and corresponding topologies of energy harvesting systems, focusing on studies published within the last 10 years. Current trends and future directions in these areas are also covered.},

abstract = {We present a self-organising reinforcement learning (RL) approach for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The approach is fully decentralised, and allows sensor nodes to schedule their active periods based only on their interactions with neighbouring nodes. Compared to standard scheduling mechanisms such as SMAC, the benefits of the proposed approach are twofold. First, the nodes do not need to synchronise explicitly, since synchronisation is achieved by the successful exchange of data messages in the data collection process. Second, the learning process allows nodes competing for the radio channel to desynchronise in such a way that radio interferences and therefore packet collisions are significantly reduced. This results in shorter communication schedules, allowing to not only reduce energy consumption by reducing the wake-up cycles of sensor nodes, but also to decrease the data retrieval latency. We implement this RL approach in the OMNET++ sensor network simulator, and illustrate how sensor nodes arranged in line, mesh and grid topologies autonomously uncover schedules that favour the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while avoiding interferences.},

WSNs are collections of sensor nodes that gather environmental data, where the main challenges are the limited power supply of nodes and the need for decentralized control. To overcome these challenges, we make each sensor node adopt an algorithm to optimize the efficiency of a small group of surrounding nodes, so that in the end the performance of the whole system is improved. We compare our approach to conventional ad-hoc networks of different sizes and show that nodes in WSNs are able to develop an energy saving behaviour on their own and significantly reduce network latency, when using our reinforcement learning algorithm.",
