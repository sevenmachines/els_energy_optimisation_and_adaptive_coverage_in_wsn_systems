ABSTRACT = {Sensing of the application environment is the main purpose of a wireless sensor network. Most existing energy management strategies and compression techniques assume that the sensing operation consumes significantly less energy than radio transmission and reception. This assumption does not hold in a number of practical applications. Sensing energy consumption in these applications may be comparable to, or even greater than, that of the radio. In this work, we support this claim by a quantitative analysis of the main operational energy costs of popular sensors, radios and sensor motes. In light of the importance of sensing level energy costs, especially for power hungry sensors, we consider compressed sensing and distributed compressed sensing as potential approaches to provide energy efficient sensing in wireless sensor networks. Numerical experiments investigating the effectiveness of compressed sensing and distributed compressed sensing using real datasets show their potential for efficient utilization of sensing and overall energy costs in wireless sensor networks. It is shown that, for some applications, compressed sensing and distributed compressed sensing can provide greater energy efficiency than transform coding and model-based adaptive sensing in wireless sensor networks.},

On the one hand, they appear to allow the next step in computer networks, building large collections of simple objects, exchanging information with respect to their environment or their own state. On the other hand, their ability to sense and communicate without a fixed physical infrastructuremakes them an attractive technology to be used for measurement systems. Although the interest inWireless Sensor Network research is increasing, and new concepts and applications are being demonstrated, several funda- mental issues remain unsolved. Whilemany of these issues do not require to be solved for proof-of-concept designs, they are important issues to be addressed when referring to the long-termoperation of these systems. One of these issues is the system's lifetime, which relates to the lifetime of the nodes, upon which the systemis composed. This thesis focuses on node lifetime extension based on energy manage- ment. While some constraints and results might hold true from a more general perspective, the main application target involves environmentalmea- surement systems based onWireless SensorNetworks.

ABSTRACT = {The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the basic building blocks of today&rsquo;s modern internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure in smart buildings, smart parking, and smart cities. The WSN nodes suffer from a major design constraint in that their battery energy is limited and can only work for a few days depending upon the duty cycle of operation. The main contribution of this research article is to propose an efficient solar energy harvesting solution to the limited battery energy problem of WSN nodes by utilizing ambient solar photovoltaic energy. Ideally, the Optimized Solar Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network (SEH-WSN) nodes should operate for an infinite network lifetime (in years). In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient solar energy harvesting system with pulse width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for WSN nodes. The research focus is to increase the overall harvesting system efficiency, which further depends upon solar panel efficiency, PWM efficiency, and MPPT efficiency. Several models for solar energy harvester system have been designed and iterative simulations were performed in MATLAB/SIMULINK for solar powered DC-DC converters with PWM and MPPT to achieve optimum results. From the simulation results, it is shown that our designed solar energy harvesting system has 87% efficiency using PWM control and 96% efficiency     (  &eta;  s y s   )     by using the MPPT control technique. Finally, an experiment for PWM controlled SEH-WSN is performed using Scientech 2311 WSN trainer kit and a Generic LM2575 DC-DC buck converter based solar energy harvesting module for validation of simulation results.},

abstract = {In a wireless sensor network (WSN), the unbalanced distribution of communication loads often causes the problem of energy hole, which means the energy of the nodes in the hole region will be exhausted sooner than the nodes in other regions. This is a key factor which affects the lifetime of the networks. In this paper we propose an improved corona model with levels for analyzing sensors with adjustable transmission ranges in a WSN with circular multi-hop deployment (modeled as concentric coronas). Based on the model we consider that the right transmission ranges of sensors in each corona is the decision factor for optimizing the network lifetime after nodes deployment. We prove that searching optimal transmission ranges of sensors among all coronas is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), which is NP hard. Therefore, we propose a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm for assigning the transmission ranges of sensors in each corona for different node distributions. The two algorithms can not only reduce the searching complexity but also obtain results approximated to the optimal solution. Furthermore, the simulation results of our solutions indicate that the network lifetime approximates to that ensured by the optimal under both uniform and non-uniform node distribution.}

@article{Guo2019,
abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, optimizing the network lifetime is an important issue. Most of the existing works define network lifetime as the time when the first sensor node exhausts all of its energy. However, such time is not necessarily important. This is because when a sensor node dies, the whole network is likely to work properly. In this article, we first make an overall consideration of the demand of applications and define the network lifetime in three aspects. Then, we construct a performance evaluation framework for routing protocols. To achieve the optimization of network lifetime in all defined aspects, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based routing protocol. Reinforcement-learning-based routing protocol takes advantage of the intelligent algorithm of reinforcement learning to search for the optimal routing path for data transmission. In the definition of reward function, factors such as link distance, residual energy, and hop count to the sink are taken into account to cut down the total energy consumption, balance the energy consumption, and improve the packet delivery. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with energy-aware routing, BEER, Q-Routing, and MRL-SCSO, reinforcement-learning-based routing protocol optimizes the network lifetime in three aspects and improves the energy efficiency.},

@article{Al-Rawi2015,
abstract = {The dynamicity of distributed wireless networks caused by node mobility, dynamic network topology, and others has been a major challenge to routing in such networks. In the traditional routing schemes, routing decisions of a wireless node may solely depend on a predefined set of routing policies, which may only be suitable for a certain network circumstances. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to address this routing challenge by enabling wireless nodes to observe and gather information from their dynamic local operating environment, learn, and make efficient routing decisions on the fly. In this article, we focus on the application of the traditional, as well as the enhanced, RL models, to routing in wireless networks. The routing challenges associated with different types of distributed wireless networks, and the advantages brought about by the application of RL to routing are identified. In general, three types of RL models have been applied to routing schemes in order to improve network performance, namely Q-routing, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and partially observable Markov decision process. We provide an extensive review on new features in RL-based routing, and how various routing challenges and problems have been approached using RL. We also present a real hardware implementation of a RL-based routing scheme. Subsequently, we present performance enhancements achieved by the RL-based routing schemes. Finally, we discuss various open issues related to RL-based routing schemes in distributed wireless networks, which help to explore new research directions in this area. Discussions in this article are presented in a tutorial manner in order to establish a foundation for further research in this field.},

	abstract = {Sensor webs consisting of nodes with limited battery power and wireless communications are deployed to collect useful information from the field. Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH by about 100 to 300{\%} when 1{\%}, 20{\%}, 50{\%}, and 100{\%} of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies. {\textcopyright} 2002 IEEE.},

It is difficult to manually collect water samples and test the presence of radioactive contamination in those samples. This also limits the area of collection. This paper reviews various methods of detecting radioactive contamination in water resources, their advantages, shortcomings and challenges during implementation. The authors have found self-maintaining, scalable, low cost Zigbee based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) supporting web technology for detecting and monitoring nuclear radiation technique developed by Li Wu et al. (2014) the most appropriate.},

An experimental, low power, low cost wireless device, designed to collect and transmit radiation measurements data from radioactive waste dumps to servers was realized and tested. It becomes active and transmits information only when a given level of radiation is exceeded, offering the advantage of a reduced power consumption. The data transmission was simulated in a mesh network. For the performance analysis was used the discrete event network simulator Qualnet 5.01 version, AODV and OLSR routing protocols being considered for the comparison purpose.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerge as an active research area in which challenging topics involve energy consumption, routing algorithms, selection of sensors location according to a given premise, robustness, efficiency, and so forth. Despite the open problems in WSNs, there are already a high number of applications available. In all cases for the design of any application, one of the main objectives is to keep the WSN alive and functional as long as possible. A key factor in this is the way the network is formed. This survey presents most recent formation techniques and mechanisms for the WSNs. In this paper, the reviewed works are classified into distributed and centralized techniques. The analysis is focused on whether a single or multiple sinks are employed, nodes are static or mobile, the formation is event detection based or not, and network backbone is formed or not. We focus on recent works and present a discussion of their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, the paper overviews a series of open issues which drive further research in the area.},

	ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks have gained significant traction in environmental signal monitoring and analysis. The cost or lifetime of the system typically depends on the frequency at which environmental phenomena are monitored. If sampling rates are reduced, energy is saved. Using empirical datasets collected from environmental monitoring sensor networks, this work performs time series analyses of measured temperature time series. Unlike previous works which have concentrated on suppressing the transmission of some data samples by time-series analysis but still maintaining high sampling rates, this work investigates reducing the sampling rate (and sensor wake up rate) and looks at the effects on accuracy. Results show that the sampling period of the sensor can be increased up to one hour while still allowing intermediate and future states to be estimated with interpolation RMSE less than 0.2 °C and forecasting RMSE less than 1 °C.},

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

EWSNs require elaborate device composition and advanced control to attain long-term operation with minimal maintenance. This article is focused on power supplies that provide energy to run the wireless sensor nodes in environmental applications. In this context, EWSNs have two distinct features that set them apart from monitoring systems in other application domains. They are often deployed in remote areas, preventing the use of mains power and precluding regular visits to exchange batteries. At the same time, their surroundings usually provide opportunities to harvest ambient energy and use it to (partially) power the sensor nodes. This review provides a comprehensive account of energy harvesting sources, energy storage devices, and corresponding topologies of energy harvesting systems, focusing on studies published within the last 10 years. Current trends and future directions in these areas are also covered.},

abstract = {We present a self-organising reinforcement learning (RL) approach for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The approach is fully decentralised, and allows sensor nodes to schedule their active periods based only on their interactions with neighbouring nodes. Compared to standard scheduling mechanisms such as SMAC, the benefits of the proposed approach are twofold. First, the nodes do not need to synchronise explicitly, since synchronisation is achieved by the successful exchange of data messages in the data collection process. Second, the learning process allows nodes competing for the radio channel to desynchronise in such a way that radio interferences and therefore packet collisions are significantly reduced. This results in shorter communication schedules, allowing to not only reduce energy consumption by reducing the wake-up cycles of sensor nodes, but also to decrease the data retrieval latency. We implement this RL approach in the OMNET++ sensor network simulator, and illustrate how sensor nodes arranged in line, mesh and grid topologies autonomously uncover schedules that favour the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while avoiding interferences.},

WSNs are collections of sensor nodes that gather environmental data, where the main challenges are the limited power supply of nodes and the need for decentralized control. To overcome these challenges, we make each sensor node adopt an algorithm to optimize the efficiency of a small group of surrounding nodes, so that in the end the performance of the whole system is improved. We compare our approach to conventional ad-hoc networks of different sizes and show that nodes in WSNs are able to develop an energy saving behaviour on their own and significantly reduce network latency, when using our reinforcement learning algorithm.",

ABSTRACT = {Optimization problems relating to wireless sensor network planning, design, deployment and operation often give rise to multi-objective optimization formulations where multiple desirable objectives compete with each other and the decision maker has to select one of the tradeoff solutions. These multiple objectives may or may not conflict with each other. Keeping in view the nature of the application, the sensing scenario and input/output of the problem, the type of optimization problem changes. To address different nature of optimization problems relating to wireless sensor network design, deployment, operation, planing and placement, there exist a plethora of optimization solution types. We review and analyze different desirable objectives to show whether they conflict with each other, support each other or they are design dependent. We also present a generic multi-objective optimization problem relating to wireless sensor network which consists of input variables, required output, objectives and constraints. A list of constraints is also presented to give an overview of different constraints which are considered while formulating the optimization problems in wireless sensor networks. Keeping in view the multi facet coverage of this article relating to multi-objective optimization, this will open up new avenues of research in the area of multi-objective optimization relating to wireless sensor networks.},

abstract="Visual coverage is an essential issue in the research on visual sensor networks. However, because of the presence of visual occlusions, the statistics of visual coverage blend the statistics of nodes and targets and are extremely difficult to derive. By assuming the deployment of nodes as a stationary Poisson point process and ignoring boundary effects, this paper presents the first attempt to estimate the probability that an arbitrary target in the field is visually k-covered. The major challenge for the estimation is how to formulate the probability (q) that a node captures a target in its visual range. To tackle this challenge, we first assume a visual detection model that takes visual occlusions into account and then derive several significant statistical parameters of q based on this model. According to these parameters, we can finally reconstruct the probability density function of q as a combination of a Binomial function and an impulse function. With the estimated coverage statistics, we further propose an estimate of the minimum node density that suffices to ensure a K-coverage across the field.",

The nature of communication in sensor networks is unpredictable and failure-prone, even more so than in regular wireless ad hoc networks. Therefore, it is essential to provide fault tolerant techniques for distributed sensor applications.

ABSTRACT = {The most important issue that must be solved in designing a data gathering algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNS) is how to save sensor node energy while meeting the needs of applications/users. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware routing protocol (EAP) for a long-lived sensor network. EAP achieves a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load among all the nodes. EAP introduces a new clustering parameter for cluster head election, which can better handle the heterogeneous energy capacities. Furthermore, it also introduces a simple but efficient approach, namely, intra-cluster coverage to cope with the area coverage problem. We use a simple temperature sensing application to evaluate the performance of EAP and results show that our protocol significantly outperforms LEACH and HEED in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data gathered.},

Despite the successes gained, the widespread adoption of WSNs particularly in remote and inaccessible places where their use is most beneficial is hampered by the major challenge of limited energy, being in most instances battery powered. To prolong the lifetime for these energy hungry sensor nodes, energy management schemes have been proposed in the literature to keep the sensor nodes alive making the network more operational and efficient. Currently, emphasis has been placed on energy harvesting, energy transfer, and energy conservation methods as the primary means of maintaining the network lifetime. These energy management techniques are designed to balance the energy in the overall network.

The lifetime of a sensor network is most commonly defined as the time to the first sensor node failure - seemingly over-pessimistic in many envisaged deployment scenarios. While other definitions exist, there has not been any consensus on which quantitative lifetime definition is most useful.

    abstract = { Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an attractive platform for monitoring and measuring physical phenomena. WSNs typically consist of hundreds or thousands of battery-operated tiny sensor nodes which are connected via a low data rate wireless network. A WSN application, such as object tracking or environmental monitoring, is composed of individual tasks which must be scheduled on each node. Naturally the order of task execution influences the performance of the WSN application. Scheduling the tasks such that the performance is increased while the energy consumption remains low is a key challenge. In this paper we apply online learning to task scheduling in order to explore the tradeoff between performance and energy consumption. This helps to dynamically identify effective scheduling policies for the sensor nodes. The energy consumption for computation and communication is represented by a parameter for each application task. We compare resource-aware task scheduling based on three online learning methods: independent reinforcement learning (RL), cooperative reinforcement learning (CRL), and exponential weight for exploration and exploitation (Exp3). Our evaluation is based on the performance and energy consumption of a prototypical target tracking application. We further determine the communication overhead and computational effort of these methods. }

abstract = {The increased demand of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in different areas of application have intensified studies dedicated to the deployment of sensor nodes in recent past. For deployment of sensor nodes some of the key objectives that need to be satisfied are coverage of the area to be monitored, net energy consumed by the WSN, lifetime of the network, and connectivity and number of deployed sensors. In this article the sensor node deployment task has been formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization (MO) problem where the aim is to find a deployed sensor node arrangement to maximize the area of coverage, minimize the net energy consumption, maximize the network lifetime, and minimize the number of deployed sensor nodes while maintaining connectivity between each sensor node and the sink node for proper data transmission. We assume a tree structure between the deployed nodes and the sink node for data transmission. Our method employs a recently developed and very competitive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) known as MOEA/D-DE that uses a decomposition approach for converting the problem of approximation of the Pareto fronts (PF) into a number of single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm employs differential evolution (DE), one of the most powerful real parameter optimizers in current use, as its search method. The original MOEA/D has been modified by introducing a new fuzzy dominance based decomposition technique. The algorithm introduces a fuzzy Pareto dominance concept to compare two solutions and uses the scalar decomposition method only when one of the solutions fails to dominate the other in terms of a fuzzy dominance level. We have compared the performance of the resulting algorithm, called MOEA/DFD, with the original MOEA/D-DE and another very popular MOEA called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The best trade-off solutions from MOEA/DFD based node deployment scheme have also been compared with a few single-objective node deployment schemes based on the original DE, an adaptive DE-variant (JADE), original particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a state-of-the art variant of PSO (Comprehensive Learning PSO). In all the test instances, MOEA/DFD performs better than all other algorithms. Also the proposed multi-objective formulation of the problem adds more flexibility to the decision maker for choosing the necessary threshold of the objectives to be satisfied.}

Decentralized detection and estimation have often been considered in the framework of parametric models, in which the statistics of phenomena under observation are assumed known to the system designer. Such assumptions are typically motivated by data or prior application-specific domain knowledge. However, when data is sparse or prior knowl-edge is vague, robust nonparametric methods are desirable.

abstract = {The fundamental challenge for randomly deployed resource-constrained wireless sensor network is to enhance the network lifetime without compromising its performance metrics such as coverage rate and network connectivity. One way is to schedule the activities of sensor nodes and form scheduling rounds autonomously in such a way that each spatial point is covered by at least one sensor node and there must be at least one communication path from the sensor nodes to base station. This autonomous activity scheduling of the sensor nodes can be efficiently done with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique of machine learning because it does not require prior environment modeling. In this paper, a Nash Q-Learning based node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance (CCM-RL) is proposed where each node autonomously learns its optimal action (active/hibernate/sleep/customize the sensing range) to maximize the coverage rate and maintain network connectivity. The learning algorithm resides inside each sensor node. The main objective of this algorithm is to enable the sensor nodes to learn their optimal action so that the total number of activated nodes in each scheduling round becomes minimum and preserves the criteria of coverage rate and network connectivity. The comparison of CCM-RL protocol with other protocols proves its accuracy and reliability. The simulative comparison shows that CCM-RL performs better in terms of an average number of active sensor nodes in one scheduling round, coverage rate, and energy consumption.},

abstract = {Evolutionary multi-agent systems (EMAS) turned out to be quite efficient technique for solving complex problems, both benchmark ones (as well-known multi-dimensional functions, e.g. Rastrigin, Schwefel etc) and more practical ones (like Optimal Golomb Ruler or Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence). However the already classic design of the EMAS (these metaheuristics have been developed for over 15 years) has still many places for improvement. Hybridization is one of such means, and it turns out that incorporating Differential Evolution mechanisms into EMAS (altering the reproduction strategy by making it more social-aware) improves the accuracy of the search. This paper deals with discussion of selected means for hybridization of EMAS with DE, and provides an insight into the efficacy of the novel algorithm compared with classic techniques based on multidimensional benchmark problems.},

abstract="Differential Evolution (DE) is generally considered as a reliable, accurate, robust and fast optimization technique. DE has been successfully applied to solve a wide range of numerical optimization problems. However, the user is required to set the values of the control parameters of DE for each problem. Such parameter tuning is a time consuming task. In this paper, a self-adaptive DE (SDE) is proposed where parameter tuning is not required. The performance of SDE is investigated and compared with other versions of DE. The experiments conducted show that SDE outperformed the other DE versions in all the benchmark functions.",

abstract = {This article proposes an evolutionary multiagent framework of the co-operative co-evolutionary multiobjective model (CCMO-EMAS), specifically for equipment layout optimization in engineering. In this framework, each agent is set in a multiobjective cooperative co-evolutionary mode along with the algorithms and corresponding settings. In each iteration, agents are executed in turn, and each agent optimizes a subpopulation from system decomposition. Additionally, the collaboration mechanism is addressed to build complete solutions and evaluate individuals in the co-operative co-evolutionary algorithm. Each subpopulation is optimized once, and the corresponding agent is evaluated based on the improvement of the system memory. Moreover, the agent team is also evolved through an elite genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed CCMO-EMAS framework is verified in a multimodule satellite equipment layout problem.},

Specifically, the proposed scheme is aimed to control the creation of random individuals by the self-adaptation of the involved parameter. An interaction scheme between random and conventional DE individuals is also proposed and analyzed. The conducted computational experiments show that self-adaptation is profitable, leading to an algorithm that is as competitive as other efficient methods and able to beat the winner of the CEC 2009 competition on dynamic environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Xu2013,
abstract = {Maximizing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a hot and significant issue. However, using differential evolution (DE) to research this problem has not appeared so far. This paper proposes a DE-based approach that can maximize the lifetime of WSN through finding the largest number of disjoint sets of sensors, with every set being able to completely cover the target. Different from other methods in the literature, firstly we introduce a common method to generate test data set and then propose an algorithm using differential evolution to solve disjoint set covers (DEDSC) problems. The proposed algorithm includes a recombining operation, which performs after initialization and guarantees at least one critical target{\&}{\#}x2019;s sensor is divided into different disjoint sets. Moreover, the fitness computation in DEDSC contains both the number of complete cover subsets and the coverage percent of incomplete cover subsets. Applications for sensing a number of target points, named point-coverage, have been used for evaluating the effectiveness of algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm DEDSC is promising and simple; its performance outperforms or is similar to other existing excellent approaches in both optimization speed and solution quality.},
