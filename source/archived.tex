When not sampling, aggregating, or broadcasting a node recovers energy at a rate given by the energy harvesting solar panel minus that lost by having the WUR in standby.

		\hline
		\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Agent-system element} \\
		\hline
		Low energy use & Remote location devices can only recover energy slowly through solar panel charging &  Use link energy consumption values to optimse learning towards efficient neighbourhoods \\
		Resilience to node failure & Remote and dangerous locations mean human maintenance is either impossible, expensive, or otherwise restricted & Neighbourhood link adaptation algorithms \\	
		Power consumption distribution & Devices have independent energy recovery mechanisms and would be overwhelmed with too much load. Although other agents would then take over this leads to unstable networks & Link energy consumption value rate accumulation for agents can be used to shape rewards to drive agent local neighbourhood adaptation away from overloaded agents  \\
