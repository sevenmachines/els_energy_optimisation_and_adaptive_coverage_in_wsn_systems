Some agents, \textit{sinks}\footnote{See Section \ref{XXX}}, will have \textit{composite tasks} allocated to them from an external source, throughout the systems' lifetime. The \textit{task-responsibilities} function maps each composite task type to the group of agents that will receive those tasks types and ensure their completion; $\formalTaskResponsibilities{}{}$. This mapping is fixed on system initialisation. Composite tasks are decomposed into their constituent \textit{atomic tasks}, with each atomic task then being either executed by the sink, or allocated to other agents to complete or relay further. Agents execute \textit{atomic tasks} which are typed. Each atomic task targets a sensor measurement at a specific location, the tasks' \textit{demand point}, $\formalTaskDemandPoint{}{}$. We assume that the further away the agent is from this point, the less value the task has to the system; e.g. the measurement is differs significantly from that at the targeted point. Atomic tasks have a \textit{resources demand}, a mapping from the type of the task to the set of resources it requires to be completed optimally, $\formalRequiredResources{}{}$.
