\section{Solving the multi-objective WSN problem}
\label{section:solution}
As defined in the previous section, we look to develop a method to optimise multiple objectives in our WSN system. To do so we will develop an algorithm, the \acronymWSNOptimisationExtended{}{} algorithm, that incorporates two existing algorithms, the \acronymATARIAExtended{}{} and \acronymMGRAOExtended{}{} algorithms. We give the high-level purpose and requirements of each algorithm in the next sections, however, full details and theoretical justification can be found in \cite{creech2021dynamic, creech2021resource}. It is the application of these previously developed algorithms to the domain of WSN that we will demonstrate in our evaluation work, how their properties meet our problem goals as stated. In addition, we evaluate how our method of combining and extending them through the \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm enables this functionality across task-paths in networks.
