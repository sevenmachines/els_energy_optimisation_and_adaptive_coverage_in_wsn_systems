\section{Solving the multi-objective WSN problem}
\label{section:solution}

We now develop a method to optimise multiple objectives in our WSN system. In the next section we give a high level description and motivation for our algorithm, then going on to define it more formally with explanation of the steps involved. We follow this with more description of the \acronymATARIA{}{} and \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithms utilised as part of the solution in Section \ref{section:solution_ataria} and \ref{section:solution_mgrao}.
