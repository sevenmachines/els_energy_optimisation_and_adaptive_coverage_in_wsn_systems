\section{Solving the multi-objective WSN problem}
\label{section:solution}

\todo[inline]{HERE}
As defined in the previous section, we develop a method to optimise multiple objectives in our WSN system. In the next section we give a high level description and motivation for the main \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm, then going on to define the algorithm more formally with explanation of the steps involved. We follow this with more description of the \acronymATARIA{}{} and \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithms utilised as part of the solution in Section \ref{section:solution_ataria} and \ref{section:solution_mgrao}.
