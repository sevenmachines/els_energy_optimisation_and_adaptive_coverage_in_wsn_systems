\section{Solving the multi-objective WSN problem}
\label{section:solution}
As defined in the previous section, we develop a method to optimise multiple objectives in our WSN system. To do so we will detail the \acronymWSNOptimisationExtended{}{} algorithm, which integrates two existing algorithms, the \acronymATARIAExtended{}{} and \acronymMGRAOExtended{}{} algorithms. In the next section, Section \ref{section:solution_anhtao}, we give a high level description and motivation for the main \acronymWSNOptimisation{}{} algorithm, then going on to define the algorithm more formally in Section \ref{section:solution_formal} with explanation of the steps involved. We follow this with more discussion of the \acronymATARIA{}{} and \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithms utilised as part of the solution in Section \ref{section:solution_ataria} and \ref{section:solution_mgrao}.
