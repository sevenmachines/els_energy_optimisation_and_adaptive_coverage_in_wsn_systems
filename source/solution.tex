We now develop a method to optimise multiple objectives in our WSN system. In the next section we give a high level description and motivation for our algorithm, then going on to define it more formally with explanation of the steps involved. We follow this with detail on the \acronymATARIA{}{} and \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithms, from previous work \citep{creech2021dynamic,creech2021resource}, utilised as part of the solution in Section \ref{section:solution_ataria} and \ref{section:solution_mgrao}.
