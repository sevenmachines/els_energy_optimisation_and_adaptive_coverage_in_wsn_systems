\section{Evaluation of Environmental Wireless Sensor Networks (E-WSN)}
\label{section:experimental}	
The simulation framework to evaluate the algorithms' performance was based on a realistic deployment scenario as covered by  \cite{Gomez2015} and others such as \cite{Jha2016} and \cite{Avram}. In this scenario a UAV is used to deploy a large number of sensors over a expansive and remote geographical area, giving an ad-hoc, randomised placement of devices. Solar power cells are used to maintain enough energy to power the sensors over a number of years, given low enough power consumption.
