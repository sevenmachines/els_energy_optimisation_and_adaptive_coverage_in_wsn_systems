\label{section:overview:resources}
\reviewquestionopen{Isn't energy just one resource that an agent can have and use for tasks? You gave it as the example of a resource in Section 3.2. If so, why is there a section (Section 3.5) on just one particular resource type? Are you implying that this type of resource is always an element of R for every system (and if so, where do you say this)? You define energy as being used for things other than enacting an atomic task - transmission and receiving - so are other resources also used up by these actions? In Section 3.2, you define ra as giving the resources allocated to 'completing' task types, but does 'completing' include receiving, transmitting and sensing, or only sensing? If the latter, then where is the allocation of resources for receiving and transmitting? If it is correct that you want to highlight a particular kind of resource, then it would be good to give that resource a name, e.g. $energy \in R$.

Agents will have to use \textit{resources} $\varResource{}{}$ to complete tasks and for general operations. These resources are of one of the types $\varResourceType{}{}$ shown below, given by the mapping $\formalResourceType{}{}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{compute resources}, $\varResourceTypeCompute{}{}$, used in activating a sensor and taking a reading. Each agent has the same, fixed, amount of compute resource, which it must share amongst its current tasks. The less allocated to a task, the lower the quality of its' completion. 
	\item \textit{memory resources}, $\varResourceTypeMemory{}{}$,  this restricts the amount of knowledge an agent can have at any one time. Each agent has the same, fixed, amount of this resource.
	\item \textit{energy resources}, $\varResourceTypeEnergy{}{}$,  which are required to transmit and receive task requests, results, and knowledge between agents. Each agent has the same, fixed, maximum amount of energy in its battery at system initialisation. Each action uses some of this energy, which is gradually replenished by a solar panel. Over time, the maximum energy storage decreases as the battery wears and degrades.
\end{itemize}
