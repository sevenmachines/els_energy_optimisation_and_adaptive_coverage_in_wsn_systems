\paragraph{System task execution flow}

At a high-level, the flow of task execution is as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An agent receives a tasks from an external agent.
	\item The agent executes or allocates these tasks to other agents in the system, which may also re-allocate them.
	\item Agents' execute tasks by taking measurements using its sensors.
	\item The task results are transmitted back to the agent that allocated the task.
	\item The results are re-transmitted by each agent back the agent that allocated them the corresponding task until they reach the sink agent.
	\item The sink agent aggregates all the task results and transmits them to the external agent.
\end{enumerate}
