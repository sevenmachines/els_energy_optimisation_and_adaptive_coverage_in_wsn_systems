The \acronymMGRAO{}{} algorithm helps agents executing atomic tasks allocate their resources to optimise the corresponding composite task value.

This has two parts, an update algorithm that adjusts weights of resources based on received atomic task values, $\label{eq:mgrao_update}\formalMGRAOUpdate{}{}$,  and the application of these weights to generate the task execution quality itself, $\label{eq:mgrao_weighting}\formalMGRAOWeighting{}{}$. The update algorithm will change the resource weightings for an agent, $\functionAgentResources{}{}$, given the type of an atomic task completed, and the its absolute task value to the corresponding composite task. The weighting algorithm simply returns the resource weighting for calculation of an atomic tasks' quality $\functionAtomicTaskQualitySignature{}{}$ on its completion.
