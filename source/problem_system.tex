\paragraph{System definition}
\label{section:system_definition}

We define the agent-based system as the tuple, $\langle 
	\setAtomicTask{}{},
	\setCompositeTask{}{},
	\setResource{}{},
	\setAgents{}{},
	\varTransmissionEnergy{}{},
	\varReceiverEnergy{}{},
	\varSensorEnergy{}{}
\rangle$, where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\setAtomicTask{}{}$ is a set of atomic tasks where each task is of type $\varAtomicTaskType{}{} \in \setAtomicTaskType{}{}$, and is performed by a single agent;
	\item $\setCompositeTask{}{} \subseteq \powerSetSymbol{\setAtomicTask{}{}}{}{}$ is the set of composite tasks that occur in the system where each task is of type $\varCompositeTaskType{}{} \in \setCompositeTaskType{}{}$;
	\item $\setResource{}{}$ is a set of resources needed to perform atomic tasks and to take actions;
	\item $\setAgents{}{}$ is a set of agents in the system.
	\item $\varTransmissionEnergy{}{}, \varReceiverEnergy{}{},\varSensorEnergy{}{}$ are constants representing the energy required to transmit and receive messages, and activate sensors, to be discussed further in Section \ref{section:problem:dominant_energy_costs}.
\end{itemize}
