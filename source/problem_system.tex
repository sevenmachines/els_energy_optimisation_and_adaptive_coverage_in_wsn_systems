\paragraph{System definition}
\label{section:system_definition}

We define the agent-based system as the tuple, $\langle 
	\setAtomicTask{}{},
	\setCompositeTask{}{},
	\setResource{}{},
	\setAgents{}{}
\rangle$, where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\setAtomicTask{}{}$ is a set of atomic tasks where each task is a measurement task performed by a single agent;
	\item $\setCompositeTask{}{} \subseteq \powerSetSymbol{\setAtomicTask{}{}}{}{}$ is the set of composite tasks that occur in the system;
	\item $\setResource{}{}$ is a set of resources needed to perform atomic tasks;
	\item $\setAgents{}{}$ is a set of agents in the system.
\end{itemize}
