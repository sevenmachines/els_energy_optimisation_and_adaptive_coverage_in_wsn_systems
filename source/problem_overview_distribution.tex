The WSN is deployed over a finite geographical area, with agents (and tasks) randomly located within this bounded area, such as occurs in an aerial deployment \citep{Kumar2013}.  The network structure formed may be flat or hierarchical, with or without clustering, dependent on the choice of protocol used \citep{Carlos-Mancilla2016b}. The map is covered by a unit-normalised 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system\footnote{The algorithms that follow are equally valid for other coordinate systems and more dimensions but we use the simplest implementable here for clarity of presentation.},  $(\setRealNumbersUnit{}{} \times \setRealNumbersUnit{}{})$\footnote{The coordinate system is scaled such that the maximum distance between any components in the system will be $\sqrt{2}$. This is for simplicity in further definitions and equations but is not a requirement for applicability of the algorithms presented.}. An agents' \textit{deployment} is then its mapping to a specific $(x, y)$ location in this coordinate system; $\formalDeployment{}{}$

A agents' hardware has a maximum distance it can effectively communicate with other agents \cite{Radman2010}. This range can be increased by dedicating more of its battery power to broadcasting \cite{Padmanabh2008, Song2009}. The effective range is also effected by conditions and obstructions close to the agents location. We define the agents' \textit{transmission range} by $\formalTransmissionRange{}{}$.
