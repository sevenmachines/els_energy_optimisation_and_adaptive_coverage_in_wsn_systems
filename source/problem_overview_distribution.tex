The WSN is deployed over a finite geographical area, with agents (and tasks) randomly located within this bounded area, such as occurs in an aerial deployment \citep{Kumar2013}.  The agents form an ad-hoc network, which may be flat, hierarchical, or clustered, dependent on the choice of protocol used \citep{Carlos-Mancilla2016b}. This area is overlaid by a unit-normalised 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system\footnote{The algorithms that follow are equally valid for other coordinate systems and more dimensions but we use the simplest implementable here for clarity of presentation.},  $(\setRealNumbersUnit{}{} \times \setRealNumbersUnit{}{})$\footnote{The coordinate system is scaled such that the maximum distance between any components in the system will be $\sqrt{2}$. This is for simplicity in further definitions and equations but is not a requirement for applicability of the algorithms presented.}. An agents' \textit{deployment} is then its mapping to a specific $(x, y)$ location in this coordinate system; $\formalDeployment{}{}$ An agents' hardware has a range it can effectively communicate with other agents,. This can be increased by and agent dedicating more of its power to its transceiver \citep{Padmanabh2008, Song2009, Radman2010}, but may also be effected by weather conditions or obstructions close to the agents' location that impede a transmissions' path the target agent. We define the \textit{transmission range} of one agent to another by $\formalTransmissionRange{}{}$.
