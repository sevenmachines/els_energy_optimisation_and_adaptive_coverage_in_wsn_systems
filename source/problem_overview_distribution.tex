The WSN is deployed over a finite geographical area, with agents (and tasks) randomly located within this bounded area, such as occurs in an aerial deployment \citep{Kumar2013}.  The agents form an ad-hoc network, which may be flat, hierarchical, or clustered \citep{Carlos-Mancilla2016b}. This area is overlaid by a unit-normalised 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,  $(\setRealNumbersUnit{}{} \times \setRealNumbersUnit{}{})$ that covers all agents and possible measurement locations in the system. The scale is such that the maximum distance between any locations referenced over the systems' lifetime will be $\sqrt{2}$\footnote{The choice of coordinate system, dimensions, and scaling is for simplicity in further definitions and equations but is not a requirement for applicability of the algorithms presented.}. An agents' \textit{deployment} is then its mapping to a specific $(x, y)$ location in this coordinate system; $\formalDeployment{}{}$.

An agents' hardware has a range it can effectively communicate with other agents. The agent can increase this range by dedicating more of its power to its transceiver \citep{Padmanabh2008, Song2009, Radman2010}. The range may also be effected by weather conditions or obstructions close to the agents' location that impede a transmissions' path the target agent. We define the \textit{transmission range} of one agent to another by $\formalTransmissionRange{}{}$.
