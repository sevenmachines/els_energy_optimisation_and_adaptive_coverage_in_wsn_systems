In this section we will formally set out the problem we look to solve.  Agents will complete tasks, carry out a number of different actions, and assume different roles in task completion. We define these and other base concepts of our WSN system in Section \ref{section:problem:properties}. The performance of agents in doing so, and how they consume resources, and the utility of the system overall is the subject of Section \ref{section:problem:optimising_resource_usage}. We then look at how we measure the success the system in meeting the goals of coverage, resilience, and lifetime in Section \ref{section:problem:coverage}. Finally we state the multi-objective WSN problem in Section \ref{section:problem:definition}.
