In this section we will formally set out the problem we look to solve.  Agents will complete tasks, carry out a number of different actions, and assume different roles in task completion. We define these and other base concepts of our WSN system in Section \ref{section:problem:properties}. The performance of agents in doing so, how they consume resources, and the problem of improving the utility of the system overall is the subject of Section \ref{section:problem:optimising_resource_usage}. We state the problem in \ref{section:problem:statement}.
