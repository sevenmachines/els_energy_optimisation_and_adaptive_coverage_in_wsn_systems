In this section we will formally set out the problem we look to solve. We define the base concepts of our WSN system in Sections \ref{section:problem:properties}. Agents will complete tasks, carry out a number of different actions, and assume different roles in executing each individual task. Their performance in doing so, and how they consume resources, is the subject of Section \ref{section:problem:optimising_resource_usage}. We then look at how we measure the performance of the system against the goals of coverage, resilience, and system lifetime as discussed previously \ref{section:problem:coverage}. Finally we define the multi-objective WSN problem in Section \ref{section:problem:definition}.
