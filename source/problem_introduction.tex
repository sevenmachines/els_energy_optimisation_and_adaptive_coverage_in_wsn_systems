In this section we will formally set out the problem we look to solve. Firstly, we define our WSN system in terms of agents, available resources, and tasks to be completed. Then we go on to look at the roles different agents play in completing a measurement task, and how energy is consumed in doing so. We next detail task coverage, and how this relates to the resilience of the network to impacts and failures. Finally, we define to what quality a measurement is completed, and how this, energy availability, and energy distribution in the system, effects the quality of overall composite task completion.
