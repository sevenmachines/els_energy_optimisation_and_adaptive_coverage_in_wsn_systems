In this section we will formally set out the problem we look to solve. Firstly, we define our WSN system in terms of agents, available resources, and tasks to be completed. Then we go on to look at the roles different agents play in completing a measurement task, and how energy is consumed in doing so. We next detail task coverage, and how this relates to the resilience of the network to impacts and failures. Finally, we define to what quality a measurement is completed, and how this, energy availability, and energy distribution in the system, effects the quality of overall composite task completion. 

\subsection{Wireless sensor network components and terminology}

A WSN system is comprised of a set of \textit{nodes} or \textit{agents}. Each agent is equipped with a microcontroller for computation, a battery for power storage, a wireless transceiver for  transmitting and receiving messages from other agents, and one or more \textit{sensors} for sensing and measuring some property of the environment such as temperature or radiation levels \citep{muhammad_r_ahmed_2012_1072589}. The agents may be deployed to precise locations or through more random distribution. The network structure formed may be flat or hierarchical, with or without clustering, dependent on the choice of protocol used \citep{Carlos-Mancilla2016b}. Requests for measurement from outside the WSN are received from a capable agent, a \textit{sink node}, which may then relay these requests through other agents until a final measurement is made by a \textit{sensing node}. This sequence of agents comprising the measurement task execution are defined as the \textit{task arc}. These concepts are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:grid_concept} and will be detailed in the following sections.
