\paragraph{Agents}
A WSN system is comprised of a set of interconnected hardware \textit{nodes}. Each node is equipped with the following components \citep{muhammad_r_ahmed_2012_1072589};
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a microcontroller for computation.
	\item sensors for measuring some property of the environment such as temperature or radiation levels.
	\item memory storage for holding the results of measurements and knowledge about the system.
	\item battery storage, providing power for operational functions, sensor measurements, and communication.
	\item a solar panel for recharging the battery.
	\item  a wireless transceiver for  transmitting and receiving messages from other nodes.
\end{enumerate}

Each node has an \textit{agent} $\varAgent{}{}$, a software controller that instructs its actions. For simplicity, we will use the term 'agent' to refer to both the software controller and the hardware node it controls.
