abstract = {There has been an increase in research interest in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as a result of the potential for their widespread use in many different areas like home automation, security, environmental monitoring, and many more. Despite the successes gained, the widespread adoption of WSNs particularly in remote and inaccessible places where their use is most beneficial is hampered by the major challenge of limited energy, being in most instances battery powered. To prolong the lifetime for these energy hungry sensor nodes, energy management schemes have been proposed in the literature to keep the sensor nodes alive making the network more operational and efficient. Currently, emphasis has been placed on energy harvesting, energy transfer, and energy conservation methods as the primary means of maintaining the network lifetime. These energy management techniques are designed to balance the energy in the overall network. The current review presents the state of the art in the energy management schemes, the remaining challenges, and the open issues for future research work.},

Collected data are retrieved directly from the equipment at the end of the experiment and after the unit is recovered. The implementation of a wireless sensor network provides an alternative solution by deploying a larger number of disposable sensor nodes. Nodes are equipped with sensors with less precision, however, the network as a whole provides better spatial resolution of the area and the users can have access to the data immediately.

	abstract = {The operational efficiency of remote environmental wireless sensor networks (EWSNs) has improved tremendously with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies over the past few years. EWSNs require elaborate device composition and advanced control to attain long-term operation with minimal maintenance. This article is focused on power supplies that provide energy to run the wireless sensor nodes in environmental applications. In this context, EWSNs have two distinct features that set them apart from monitoring systems in other application domains. They are often deployed in remote areas, preventing the use of mains power and precluding regular visits to exchange batteries. At the same time, their surroundings usually provide opportunities to harvest ambient energy and use it to (partially) power the sensor nodes. This review provides a comprehensive account of energy harvesting sources, energy storage devices, and corresponding topologies of energy harvesting systems, focusing on studies published within the last 10 years. Current trends and future directions in these areas are also covered.},

@article{Xu2014f,
	abstract = {With the rapid development of society and the economy, an increasing number of human activities have gradually destroyed the marine environment. Marine environment monitoring is a vital problem and has increasingly attracted a great deal of research and development attention. During the past decade, various marine environment monitoring systems have been developed. The traditional marine environment monitoring system using an oceanographic research vessel is expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently been considered as potentially promising alternatives for monitoring marine environments since they have a number of advantages such as unmanned operation, easy deployment, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art technologies in the field of marine environment monitoring using wireless sensor networks. It first describes application areas, a common architecture of WSN-based oceanographic monitoring systems, a general architecture of an oceanographic sensor node, sensing parameters and sensors, and wireless communication technologies. Then, it presents a detailed review of some related projects, systems, techniques, approaches and algorithms. It also discusses challenges and opportunities in the research, development, and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine environment monitoring.},

    abstract = { Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an attractive platform for monitoring and measuring physical phenomena. WSNs typically consist of hundreds or thousands of battery-operated tiny sensor nodes which are connected via a low data rate wireless network. A WSN application, such as object tracking or environmental monitoring, is composed of individual tasks which must be scheduled on each node. Naturally the order of task execution influences the performance of the WSN application. Scheduling the tasks such that the performance is increased while the energy consumption remains low is a key challenge. In this paper we apply online learning to task scheduling in order to explore the tradeoff between performance and energy consumption. This helps to dynamically identify effective scheduling policies for the sensor nodes. The energy consumption for computation and communication is represented by a parameter for each application task. We compare resource-aware task scheduling based on three online learning methods: independent reinforcement learning (RL), cooperative reinforcement learning (CRL), and exponential weight for exploration and exploitation (Exp3). Our evaluation is based on the performance and energy consumption of a prototypical target tracking application. We further determine the communication overhead and computational effort of these methods. }

@article{Sengupta2013,
abstract = {The increased demand of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in different areas of application have intensified studies dedicated to the deployment of sensor nodes in recent past. For deployment of sensor nodes some of the key objectives that need to be satisfied are coverage of the area to be monitored, net energy consumed by the WSN, lifetime of the network, and connectivity and number of deployed sensors. In this article the sensor node deployment task has been formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization (MO) problem where the aim is to find a deployed sensor node arrangement to maximize the area of coverage, minimize the net energy consumption, maximize the network lifetime, and minimize the number of deployed sensor nodes while maintaining connectivity between each sensor node and the sink node for proper data transmission. We assume a tree structure between the deployed nodes and the sink node for data transmission. Our method employs a recently developed and very competitive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) known as MOEA/D-DE that uses a decomposition approach for converting the problem of approximation of the Pareto fronts (PF) into a number of single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm employs differential evolution (DE), one of the most powerful real parameter optimizers in current use, as its search method. The original MOEA/D has been modified by introducing a new fuzzy dominance based decomposition technique. The algorithm introduces a fuzzy Pareto dominance concept to compare two solutions and uses the scalar decomposition method only when one of the solutions fails to dominate the other in terms of a fuzzy dominance level. We have compared the performance of the resulting algorithm, called MOEA/DFD, with the original MOEA/D-DE and another very popular MOEA called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The best trade-off solutions from MOEA/DFD based node deployment scheme have also been compared with a few single-objective node deployment schemes based on the original DE, an adaptive DE-variant (JADE), original particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a state-of-the art variant of PSO (Comprehensive Learning PSO). In all the test instances, MOEA/DFD performs better than all other algorithms. Also the proposed multi-objective formulation of the problem adds more flexibility to the decision maker for choosing the necessary threshold of the objectives to be satisfied. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
